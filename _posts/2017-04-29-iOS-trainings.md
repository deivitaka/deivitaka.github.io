Since the 14th of April me and Klevis are conducting weekly iOS development trainings for anyone interested to learn more on the topic. We are trying to focus on the basics and build from that. At the end of the training we hope to expand (even a bit) the network of young and passionate developers in a market eager for more.

Thanks to Innovation Hub Tirana for opening their offices and heart to us. Special thanks to EasyPay Albania and Dentem, for their continuous support. After the final session chosen trainees will have the possibility of an internship with these companies.
