title: Hydration App
subtitle: A beautiful hydration tracker
description: How much water should you drink a day? Everybody has different needs. The app helps you establish your personal hydration goals and daily targets, and make sure that drinking water becomes second nature. It includes level progression and achievements for motivation, reminders to reach the daily goal, newsfeed to stay up-to-date, and statistics to see a quick overview of your drinking habits. And the cherry on top - it connects to LUCY Smart Cap, so every sip is logged automatically with no effort.
