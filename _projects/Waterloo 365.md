title: Waterloo 365
subtitle: The perfect solution for managing water
description: I have contributed to this amazing app that helps citizens keep track of their water consumption. It also communicates with the water utility to submit readings when a period is closing. You can take advantage of the OCR feature to scan the meter directly, compare consumption to the similar households, etc.
