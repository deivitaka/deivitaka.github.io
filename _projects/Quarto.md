title: Quarto 2D
subtitle: A challenging board game
description: Quarto 2D is my first published game. It started as a University project for Artificial Intelligence and I wanted to see it on the store one day. Its a simple game to learn with minimal rules, but still challenging. The computer player comes in three dificulties and the Expert level I would say is pretty tough to beat.
