title: Rossmann Azubi Tag
subtitle: The "Trainee day app" for Dirk Rossmann GmbH
description: 
    Around 700 trainees start their careers at Dirk Rossmann GmbH every year. For a day there is a cheerful atmosphere of optimism in Burgwedel - the focus is on getting to know the company and its contacts. I was lucky to build the iOS version of the app the trainees would use during this day. The app is packed with a lot of information, and has other options like chat, surveys etc to help users have an easier integration.
