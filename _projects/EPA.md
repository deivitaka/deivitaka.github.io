title: EPA (EasyPay Personal Assistant)
subtitle: A Messenger chatbot
description:
    Messenger chatbot was a fresh new direction for EasyPay to go into, and also for the Albanian market to have a similar solution in the local language. The chatbot, nicknamed EPA, is able to answer basic questions about EasyPay, search for obligations for several services (including more than one step of input giving), saving contracts for future searches, searching for nearest agent locations, link with the EasyPay account for seamless integration, etc. As all bots, it cannot possibly have an answer to everything, but even then it can fallback in an elegant way. A neat project I am glad I was able to develop and deploy.
