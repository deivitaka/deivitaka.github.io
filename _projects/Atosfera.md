subtitle: The winning project of SpaceApps 2016 (Albania)
description:
    "As part of a SpaceApp challenge, we took a team effort to develop an application that monitors the air components parameters. \"Atmosphera\" notifies users when the parameters are above normal, or critical for their health condition. The real-time data would help people with special health conditions, or serve as general information for the public. The project won first place and received a Global Nomination."
