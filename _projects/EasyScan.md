title: EasyScan
subtitle: An Identification Document scanner
description:
    Used internally by EasyPay's hundreds of agents, the app helps input information from clients' ID by using OCR. Communicating directly with the internal systems, it makes the experience seamless, instead of having to type a list of details, prone to human error. The photo of the ID is also saved in the process.
