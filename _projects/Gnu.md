subtitle: Find a common meeting time with your friends
description:
    GNU is an app I have contributed to. We all know sometimes it is hard to find a common time when you and your friends are all available to meet. GNU makes this task easy, allowing to find a common time automatically, or create events at a fixed time and invite friends.
