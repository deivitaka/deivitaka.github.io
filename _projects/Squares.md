subtitle: From paper to software. A game I like.
description: This game got me fixated for a long time a few years back. We used to play it on pieces of paper for hours. I am so glad I was able to build and play it on the PC. The design nowadays could be better indeed, but its a solid game nevertheless. For the ones unfamiliar with the rules, each player takes turns drawing (or selecting in this case) a line. If you manage to create a square with the lines, you score a point. The player with most points when there are no more available lines, wins.
