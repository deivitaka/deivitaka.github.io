subtitle: A project proposal
description: 
    This is a project proposal I worked on with a couple of friends for ADISA (Agency for the Delivery of Integrated Services Albania) as part of their open competition. The solution consisted of an iOS and Android application that comunicated with a RESTful API. It would offer Albanian citizens information on a variety of public services, give users voice to send their feedback or opinion, set appointments through the app, etc. Unfortunately it was the runner-up project, and did not get implemented.
