title: Waterloo Control
subtitle: A neat task manager for water suppliers
description: WATERLOO Control makes it super convenient to monitor hydrants, wells, and other supply systems. With the user-friendly app, every water supplier makes the leap into digitization. I had the opportunity to develop the iOS app from scratch for iPhone and iPad, supporting also dark mode.
